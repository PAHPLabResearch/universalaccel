\title{Assign bins using embedded NHANES IG reference edges (bin_edges)}
\usage{
ua_assign_bins(
  DT,
  epoch_sec,
  location = "ndw",
  metrics = NULL,
  per_day = TRUE,
  id_col = "id",
  time_col = "time",
  metric_col = "metric",
  value_col = "value"
)
}
\description{
\itemize{
\item Binning ONLY. No zone assignment here.
\item bin_edges currently exist only for epoch_sec = 5 or 60.
\item Stops if epoch_sec is not 5 or 60.
}
}
\details{
Output columns:
metric, bin_i, id, day (if per_day), n, time_bin_min,
lower, upper, midpoint, width, log_midpoint, log_time_bin,
epoch_sec, location, cm_time_min

Notes:
\itemize{
\item cm_time_min is computed as descending cumulative minutes within (id,day,metric):
minutes at/above the bin (complementary cumulative), which is commonly used in IG.
\item If per_day=TRUE and DT has no usable 'day', day is computed as dense index of calendar date per id.
}
}
